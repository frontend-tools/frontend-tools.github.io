UglifyJS: Online JavaScript minifier
====================================

UglifyJS 2 is an excellent tool to help you minify your JavaScript! It's a tried and tested tool, used by libraries such as jQuery.

This is a simple wrapper for the browser around the minifier; the hard work is done by [Mihai Bazon](http://lisperator.net/). If you need an automated solution, I suggest checking out the [source code](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), intended for Node.JS.

Do you want to help improve this tool? It's on [Github](https://github.com/Skalman/UglifyJS-online).
